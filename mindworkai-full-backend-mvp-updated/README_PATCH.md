Backend Patch Overview
Included new folders and files to implement:
- Authentication with JWT (signup/login)
- Exchange service placeholders (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken)
- Web3 wallet & contract utilities (ethers.js)

2. Merge or adapt package.json dependencies into your existing backend/package.json and run `npm install`.
3. Set environment variable JWT_SECRET for production.
4. Replace placeholder logic (in-memory users, Infura key, etc.) with real DB and API keys.
